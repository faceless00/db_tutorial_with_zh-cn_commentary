# Introduction
This si a Fork from cstack 's [db_tutorial](https://github.com/cstack/db_tutorial).  
I add some commentary in chinese and change some code to cpp(.e.g printf->cout).  
Also i write an [article](https://faceless00.github.io/2022/04/10/yourSql/)(in fact,just a translation) in chinese about this.

# Usage
Use `make` to compile the source code.After compiling will create a new executable file called "db".
